    <li>
     1/2 cup beef broth   
    </li>
    <li>
     2 cloves garlic, minced   
    </li>
    <li>
     1 tsp ginger, grated   
    </li>
    <li>
     1 tbsp vegetable oil   
    </li>
    <li>
     1/2 tsp black pepper

    <li>    
     1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)   
    </li>
    <li>
     1 green onion, sliced (for garnish)            
    </li>   
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>
        In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, cornstarch, and beef broth. Mix well and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the minced garlic and grated ginger, and saut√© for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the sliced beef to the skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes until browned on all sides. Avoid overcrowding the pan; cook in batches if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour the sauce mixture over the beef in the skillet. Stir well to coat the beef evenly with the sauce.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken and the beef to absorb the flavors. If you like it spicy, add red pepper flakes at this stage.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove from heat and garnish with sliced green onions.
    </li>
    <li>
        Serve hot with steamed rice or noodles. Enjoy your delicious beef dish!
