     2 tbsp olive oil

     3 cloves garlic, minced

    <li>
     1 bell pepper, chopped  
    </li>
    <li>
     1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes  
    </li>
    <li>
     1 cup chicken broth  
    </li>
    <li>
     1 tsp paprika  
    </li>
    <li>
     1 tsp dried oregano

    <li>
     1/2 tsp cumin

     Salt and pepper to taste

    <li>
     Fresh parsley or cilantro for garnish  
    </li>   
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the chopped bell pepper to the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes until slightly tender.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stir in the diced tomatoes (with their juice), chicken broth, paprika, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper. Bring the mixture to a simmer.
    </li>
    <li>
        Return the browned chicken pieces to the skillet. Cover and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.
    </li>
    <li>
        Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can let it simmer uncovered for a few more minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Garnish with fresh parsley or cilantro before serving. This dish pairs well with rice, couscous, or crusty bread.
    </li>
    <li>
        Serve hot and enjoy your delicious chicken dish!
